# DiagramsSplitter
This plugin reads a large diagram (by area) from Geodesign Hub and splits it into three subcomponents of 70% area, 20% area and 10% of the area and then uploads them back to Geodesign. 

It can be useful when there is a large diagram that can be too expensive to build or if you want to split diagram into stages.
